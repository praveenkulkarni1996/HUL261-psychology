* Hermann Grid
	* Ganglion cells
	* Illusions
* Can perception be influenced by the way our sensory organ (eyes) is designed?  
	* Does characteristics of the eye (e.g. size) influence perception?
* Depth Perception
	* Depth perception is our ability to convert2D image into a 3D image and percive distance. 
	* How does depth perception occur?
	* Seeing a finger with one eye experiment
	* Information, thalamus
* Explanation
	* Due to the distance between our two eyes, two slightly different images are cast on the retina (binocular disparity)
	* The brain integrates the two images but uses the difference between the two images to estimate the distance between the perceiver and the object
	* Greater the distance between two objects, larger the retinal disparity, and greater the sense of depth/distance between the two objects.
* Types of monocular clues:
	* *Relative size:* Smaller the retainal image-greater the distance between teh obejct and observers. 
	* *Texture gradient:* Further away an object, it's features appear less distinct. 
* Moon Illusion
	* The moon looks bigger when it is at the horizon. 
* Motion perception
	* Motion of a moving object is perceived relative to some stable unmvoing background. (e.g. think of an approaching ball).
	* If the object is moving twards us, the image on the retina exapnds (objects occupies more and more space).
	* [Cliff experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cliff) are the strongest evidence that depth perception is innate (rather than learned). Research was commissioned because they wanted to find out if pilots could be trained to improve depth perception.
	* Can't drive at the age of 11, because motion 
	* coordination is not developed at the age of 11. Can't drink and drive ... etc.
	* Proprioception - vestibular system in the ears. 
		* Visual system factors the positon of our eyes and our head when perceiving motion. 
		* Phantom Limb
* Functions of the perception system
	* Attention
	* Localization
	* Recognition
	* Abstraction
	* Constancy
* Apparent motion, Stroboscopic motion
* Visual illusions
	* Physical stimuli that consistently produce errors in perception
	* The parthenon
	* Muller Lyer, length perception

## Thursday, 8th March: Lecture

* Who is the hunter aiming at?
	* Elephant and Deer picture
	* apriori expectations
* western interpretation vs african
	* The westerners use distance as a cue and perceive that the hunter is aiming for the antelope (which appears bigger because it is closer)
	* The African tribe fails to use this cue and perceives that the elephant is the target.
   * Cultural difference in perception.
* Subliminal perception
	* Perception without awareness.
	* A stimuli (called prime) activates a sensory system but is not intense enough for a person to be aware of experiencing it.
	* 'Prime' can be written word, sound, smell.
	* Quarter second coke superbowl ads.
		* Primes are banned in advertising now. Defense does research now.
* Extra Sensory Perception
	* ESP: An anomalous process of information transfer
	* Psi, clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition
* Total Field experiments (Ganzfield)
   * 38% of accuracy between sender-receiver.
   * 23 of of 28 replicated Ganzfield results.
   * Congitive Science versus Parapsychology.

* What is consciousness ?
  	* Euthenasia
  	* 3rd year of PhD: 
     	* Painkiller + Asthama medication - allergic reaction
     	* 12 minutes of oxygen deprivation - Hypoxia
* Lockton Phenomemon
  	* Awareness of sensation, thoughts , and feelsings we experience at a given moment
  	* A subjective understanding of both the external environment around us and our internal environment
* History of consciousness research
	* Dualism : _body contributes to consciousness_
 	* Materialism :
 	* Split brain :
 	* AI : _don't have subjectivity yet_ 
* Lunchline effect: _can quickly divert attention whenever name is mentioned_.
 	* Best known solution, we are primed to pay attention to our name. 
 	* Need to know the non-names. Discrimination.
* Kinds of consciousness
  	* Non conscious - unconscious: _Freudian slips_
  	* Access consciousness: conscious vs automatic
  	* Waking vs altered
* 3 Point of contentions
	* separation of consciousness from physical body: _first benchers vs back benchers_ 
	* existence and consciouness
	* mind-body and consciousness

* __Explanation of blindness__
  
* __What is Change Blindness?__
	* Change blindness is a phenonmemon that occurs wehn a person is unable to notice visulal changes in their enivronment, despite the fact that they are often rather obvious . In the case of ....

* __The Invisible Gorilla Study__
	* The researcher *Dianiel Simons* conducted a fascinating study into change blindness that many people find unbelievable. In Simon's' study he asked aprticipants to watch a video of a basketball being passed around between several people, with a particular focus on the basketball itself.
	* When the experiment was over, Simons found that a large number of participants were so focused on watching the basketball, that they didn't notice the gorilla.
* __Innattentional Blindness__
	* It's important to note that the change in Simon's video wasn't subtle. The gorilla is very obviously taking up much fo the frame. Simons concluded that participants were experiencing _innattentional blindness_, which is when a _person fails to notice a major change because they are focused on another task_. In this case, because participants were asked to focus on the movement of the basketball, their brains prioritized that task in order to do it properly, therby missing the other things happened in the video. 
	* In the case of Simons' study, participants engaged what's referred to as attentional selection, which is when a person selects certain things to focus on in order to achieve a task and filters out anything that is unrelated to the objective.

## Monday, 19th March: Lecture 
* __Hypnosis__
	* Heightened susceptibility to the suggestion of others in a trance-like state. 
	* Associated with organized religion and psychedelic drugs.
	* Alteration of consciousness.
* __Whom do we lock up__
	* Asylums inmates - internal world not representative of the external world.
* __Eats twins' uneaten tiffin boxes that had fallen down.__
	* Story, trajectory, knowledge.
* Story of children guessing what's in a box. 
	* Can't imagine that the box doesn't contain what he/she is thinking. 
	* Point of view, how do you see the external world, and how is it representated in your mind. It is also gained with time, and also lost with age.
* __Hypnosis, Psychological Science__
	* non-pharmalogical, non-invasive state, don't need anasthesia. 
* __Simplicity of Suggestion__
	* Self-fulfilling suggestion - _"If I say that you are going to fail, then you probably will"_.
* __Myths__
	* People do not lose all of their will power. 
	* They do not perform antisocial behaviour. 
	* THey will not carry out self-destructive acts. 
	* They do not reveal hidden truths about themselves, and are capable of lying. 
	* People cannot be hypnotized against their will.
* __Hypnosis: Theoretical debate__
	 _Is it a state different than normal waking state? Yes. Why?_ High suggestibility, increased ability to recall and construct images, acceptance of suggestions that con tradict reality, and changes in electical activity all suggest it is a different state.
	* _It is a divided consciouness. Why?_ Hypnosis dbrings a dissociation/division of sonsciousness into two components: One in which they follow the commands of the hypnotists and another they act as 'hidden observer' aware of what is happening.
	* Electirical activity is not accompanied by any other physiological changes. No evidence for recall of childhood memories. 
* __Uses/applications__
	*  Controlling pain. 
	*  Reducing smoking. 
	*  Psychological disorders (anxiety). 
	*  Law: imporoving eyewitness recall. 
	*  Sports psychology.
