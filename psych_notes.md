* Hermann Grid
	* Ganglion cells
	* Illusions
* Can perception be influenced by the way our sensory organ (eyes) is designed?  
	* Does characteristics of the eye (e.g. size) influence perception?
* Depth Perception
	* Depth perception is our ability to convert2D image into a 3D image and percive distance. 
	* How does depth perception occur?
	* Seeing a finger with one eye experiment
	* Information, thalamus
* Explanation
	* Due to the distance between our two eyes, two slightly different images are cast on the retina (binocular disparity)
	* The brain integrates the two images but uses the difference between the two images to estimate the distance between the perceiver and the object
	* Greater the distance between two objects, larger the retinal disparity, and greater the sense of depth/distance between the two objects.
* Types of monocular clues:
	* *Relative size:* Smaller the retainal image-greater the distance between teh obejct and observers. 
	* *Texture gradient:* Further away an object, it's features appear less distinct. 
* Moon Illusion
	* The moon looks bigger when it is at the horizon. 
* Motion perception
	* Motion of a moving object is perceived relative to some stable unmvoing background. (e.g. think of an approaching ball).
	* If the object is moving twards us, the image on the retina exapnds (objects occupies more and more space).
	* [Cliff experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cliff) are the strongest evidence that depth perception is innate (rather than learned). Research was commissioned because they wanted to find out if pilots could be trained to improve depth perception.
	* Can't drive at the age of 11, because motion 
	* coordination is not developed at the age of 11. Can't drink and drive ... etc.
	* Proprioception - vestibular system in the ears. 
		* Visual system factors the positon of our eyes and our head when perceiving motion. 
		* Phantom Limb
* Functions of the perception system
	* Attention
	* Localization
	* Recognition
	* Abstraction
	* Constancy
* Apparent motion, Stroboscopic motion
* Visual illusions
	* Physical stimuli that consistently produce errors in perception
	* The parthenon
	* Muller Lyer, length perception
